# 2D-Wave-Equation-Simulation---Circular-Feed-Well-Sloshing
This contains the code used for some 2D wave equation simulations used to investigate wave interference and propagation in an SPL settler tank, as liquid overflows the central feed well into the outer tank.

Note that these simulations use the following libraries which need to be installed locally before running the Python scripts:
numpy, pygame, pylab

There is also an option to output a 3D plot of the waves, by commenting/uncommenting out some sections, identified in the code already. 
The 3D plots are slow to update due to coding inefficiencies, but they are still useful to consider.

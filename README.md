# 2D-Wave-Equation-Simulation---Circular-Feed-Well-Sloshing
This contains the code used for some 2D wave equation simulations used to investigate wave interference and propagation in an SPL settler tank, as liquid overflows the central feed well into the outer tank.

Note that these simulations use the following libraries which need to be installed locally before running the Python scripts:
numpy, pygame, pylab
